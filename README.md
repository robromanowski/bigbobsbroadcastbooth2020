### **General Idea:**

**0. My take (let's hope it ages like a fine Zamorakian wine!!) - aka the OFFICIAL TOO EARLY BBBB 2020 270TOWIN map.**

**1. First section will be #Maps (showing possible models/outcomes) (not all of them included tho :sad:)**

**2. Live updates/tidbits if possible**

> NOTE: I tried to get cute with the leans/toss-ups for the ones I feel are likely but not definite, and then the really close toss-up ones that are the hardest.
> For just red/blue (same states winning/same numbers) I also made this: https://www.270towin.com/maps/wnQ9e (Promised the same 319 - 219 Biden victory).

# 1. Maps

### A. More Neutral Map - Florida toss up - Biden gets PA, I think most of this could happen

>Note:
>For Florida Decision:

>Trump 218 votes goes to 247, Biden still has enough anyways at 270.
>So for this one, doesn't matter if Trump gets FL (since Biden had PA mainly in this case).

### B. The Biden Map - Somehow he gets Florida and PA - more just for fun

# 2. OMG ITS HERE SECTION

Updates from earlier than 5pm:
- Not too much happened this early.
- Noteworthy things:
1. Florida past its 2016 vote total only a few hours into voting today (combined with early voting)
2. That's a good sign, as generally more votes favor Dems.
- Read a cool analysis on one county (Sumter - the villages (the old people) could show a lot tonight. It could:
1. hint at Florida's result
2. if we know Florida tonight we might have a better idea just after tonight

5pm+ updates:
- Exit polls came out. Economy is the biggest thing so far, not covid:
1. does that spell bad for biden since trump is usually tied to economy - or does the economy in shambles mean its good for biden?
2. nate silver harping on dont trust exit polls this year - is that denial? exit polls can be garbage so maybe it is true
- we got nothing else so far so exit polls will clearly be overreacted too - it's the only droppings we've got
- 538 is saying that florida GOP voting has seemed to slow down, maybe a good sign for dems there!

6pm+ updates:
not there yet :)

**General Idea:**

**1. First section will be #Maps (showing possible models/outcomes) (not all of them included tho :sad:)**

**2. Live updates/tidbits if possible**

# Maps

### 1. More Neutral Map - Florida toss up - Biden gets PA, I think most of this could happen

>Trump 218 votes goes to 247, Biden still has enough anyways at 270.
>So for this one, doesn't matter if Trump gets FL (since Biden had PA mainly in this case).
